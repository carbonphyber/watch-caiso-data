# Watch California ISO Usage
This repo uses GitHub actions to automatically scrape the list of California ISO electrical usage from the CAISO website frequently and store the results.

This repo uses the same datasource as the [CaliforniaISO Today's Outlook page](http://www.caiso.com/TodaysOutlook/Pages/default.aspx).
